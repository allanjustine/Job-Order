   - Short paragraphs and bullet points  

3. **CTAs**  
   - Code blocks for installation

- Badges (e.g., ![Job Order Printing System Banner](https://job-order.smctgroup.ph/logo.png))  
- Screenshots in an `## üì∏ Screenshots` section  
- Animated GIF demonstrating key features

   - Links to mobile apps when applicable  

4. **Logical Order**

  ```html

  <summary><b>How do I troubleshoot printing issues?</b></summary>
  > Check printer logs at <code>/var/log/joborder/printers.log</code>
